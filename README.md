# React Application 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project
To start the development server:
```sh
npm npm run dev
```
This will run the project on `http://localhost:5173/` (or another available port).

### Testing
To run tests:
```sh
npm test
```

## Features & Proficiency Demonstration
### Key Accomplishments
1. **Dynamic Data Loading from Excel**
   - Implemented Excel file parsing using `xlsx` to dynamically load SKU and Store data.
   - Demonstrates ability to handle file reading and structured data processing.

2. **AG Grid Integration**
   - Used `ag-grid-react` to display tabular data efficiently.
   - Implemented sorting, filtering, row dragging, and action buttons (like delete), showing proficiency in UI component customization.

3. **State Management & Performance Optimization**
   - Used `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` to manage data efficiently.
   - Avoided unnecessary re-renders by optimizing function dependencies and state updates.

## Potential Improvements
If more development time were available, I would:
- **Enhance UI/UX**: Improve styling and responsiveness.
- **Add Data Persistence**: Implement local storage or a backend API to save changes.
- **Implement Authentication**: Secure data access with user authentication.

## Feedback on the Challenge (Optional)
- The challenge was well-structured and tested practical React and TypeScript skills.
- Providing sample API endpoints instead of an Excel file could make the task more relevant to real-world applications.
